I'm currently working on the last year of my BS in Computer Science and am so excited (but also scared) to start a life in the tech industry next year. In this last year, I'm trying to learn as much as I can to be ready for Industry and I'm having a lot of fun doing so!

Some things I like to do are:
- watching anime
- doing puzzles
- playing board games
- guiltily playing and paying for gacha games 	｡ﾟ･ (>﹏<) ･ﾟ｡
- and (surprisingly) hiking (probably because of my cute doggos)

I have the most experience with using Python, Java, and C++ due to school. Though I know those languages the best, I've also been learning other languages such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and C/C# for personal projects I've been working on. I'm currently working on numerous webapps and will upload them here to showcase my work to the world. However, I know I can always improve, and would like feedback on how I can better them!
